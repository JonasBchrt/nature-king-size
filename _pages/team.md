Welcome to the Team page, where legends are born, coffee is consumed, and mysterious things happen (mostly on Tuesdays). Our team is a swirling vortex of creativity, questionable snack choices, and the occasional spreadsheet wizardry. No one really knows what anyone else does, but somehow, everything gets done—sometimes even ahead of schedule.

We have experts in fields you didn’t know existed, and at least one person who can recite the entire alphabet backwards while juggling. Our brainstorming sessions are legendary, mostly because of the hats. If you ever find yourself lost in the office, just follow the trail of post-it notes and cryptic doodles.

We believe in teamwork, telepathy, and the power of snacks. Our motto? “If you can’t find the answer, invent a new question.” Join us as we boldly go where no team has gone before—usually to the break room.
