Over the years, we've tackled a variety of projects for customers who demanded nothing less than "big nature." From installing cloud-sized birdhouses for migratory sparrows with a taste for luxury, to orchestrating synchronized leaf-falling events for autumn enthusiasts, our product has been at the heart of it all. There was even that time we helped a client who wanted their backyard to resemble a miniature rainforestâ€”complete with a fog machine and a very confused squirrel. No matter the scale or the species, we always deliver nature, king-size.
